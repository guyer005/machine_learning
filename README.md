Five variables were selected from the cleaned Kepler dataset provided by Prof. Shahin. 
These variables were selected based on a review of the Kepler data dictionary and chosen to try and optimize model fit.
The results of this effort can be seen in the Jupyter notebook. The fit parameter only achieved .78 on the training dataset
and was below the Professor's recommendation of .85 model fit. Future efforts would serve to try and improve fit and select more variables to add to the model. Due to time restrictions, I was unable to study the Kepler data and the astrophysical terminology enough to identify all the best variables.
